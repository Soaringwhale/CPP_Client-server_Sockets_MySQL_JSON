# CPP_Client-server_Sockets_MySQL_JSON
Used VS 2019.  

The client sends a request to the server, then the server can make a request to the database or execute a command on the server side. 
The result will be sent to the client.

Later i'll add readme-info on how you can easily add JSON or MySQL in VS to use in your programms.
